Space Race

Introduction This is a game I developed off of python. I wanted to incorporate a previous 
game as a 'classic' version called Moonrace, so you can play either game. The moonrace 
game though is changed, as it was originally written in Ruby, but this one is written in 
python. Major differences also include the uses of classes, functions, and dictionaries 
to store values over some of the original. The original moonrace was just a project from
another course that I modded out on my own to see further capabilities of Ruby.

The code and such is my own work. I've also created my own ascii text maps of an astronaut,
robot, and title screen, mainly because I don't want to deal with the copyright issues and
plagiarism (thus they are my own works of art, and technically copyrighted under myself).
But beyond that, I really enjoyed creating it. It took a long time to try to simplify the
coding, so there may be a lot that just can be reduced. This for me was a proof of concept
that a game can be developed on Python.

Moonrace Moonrace is a game where you're competing against a robot to the moon from the 
earth. There is an illustration showing your progress along the way. You'll notice that there
are wormholes and aliens that teleport you fwd and back. You move forward with the roll of a
die, and play on luck. The first one to the end goal wins!

Space Race Spacerace is a game where you're competing against either 1, 2, or 3 other players,
or just a robot. Added features include comets, shields, and bombs. Your ship has its own 
shielding, and if you lose it all, your character dies. The comets will damage your shield,
unless you have a bomb to break it. Alternatively, you can dispose of a bomb to set back the 
other player's shielding. Choice is up to you. You also have a bonus point to your die roll if
you guess the roll correctly. First to the planet wins!

Features Key features in both are a difficulty level, with the ability to create your own custom map. Each mode does have graphics to illustrate your positions. The final screens will show my cool illustrations that I made with Ascii symbols. I'm happy with how the result turned out. It took maybe 60-70 hours in total to make, and you'll notice there are 700+ lines of code (to be fair, if reduced its probably in the 600+ range or so).

I'm happy with this project, I hope you get to enjoy it!
